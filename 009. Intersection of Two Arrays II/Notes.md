# PROBLEM STATEMENT

Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in any order.


# EXAMPLE

    Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
    Output: [2,2]


The Problem "Intersection of Two Arrays" differs from this one in the sense that in that problem, each element in output array was unique.

Here, we need to include each matching character.


If both arrays were already sorted, then the Two Pointers approach would've been the best.
