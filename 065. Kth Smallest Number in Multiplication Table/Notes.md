# PROBLEM STATEMENT

Nearly everyone has used the Multiplication Table. The multiplication table of size m x n is an integer matrix mat where mat[i][j] == i * j (1-indexed).

Given three integers m, n, and k, return the kth smallest element in the m x n multiplication table.

# EXAMPLE

    Input: m = 3, n = 3, k = 5
    Output: 3
    
Explanation: The 5th smallest number is 3.
